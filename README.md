- I am studying for security interviews. This is my plan on how I am studying. My notes consist mostly of a list of terms and technologies to learn, plus little tidbits that help me remember certain details. At the end are interview tips I am making for myself. 

If you are less confident at coding: Spend more time writing small scripts and studying features of your preferred language. Coding is essential (even if you don't like it or you don't use it much in your current role). I have a section on coding in this list.

If you are less confident at security topics: I recommend doing a lot of reading and whenever you come across a term you are unfamiliar with or couldn't easily explain, then add it to the list.
